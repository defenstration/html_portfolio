<h1>David's Favorite Movies</h1>
<h2>My 3 favorite movies of <b>ALL TIME!!!</b></h2>

<hr />

<p>We are going to look at my favorite movies ever, genre by genre.</p>

<h3>Comedy</h3>

<h4>The Gamers: Dorkness Rising</h4>

<p>Dead Gentleman are an indie film company from Seattle, Washington, and while they have made several movies that I enjoy, the one that introduced me to them was The Gamers: Dorkness Rising.</p>

<h3>Action</h3>

<h4>The A Team</h4>

<p>While I am not old enough to have watched the series when it originally aired, The A Team movie was so much fun that I went back to watch the show (Worth It!). I mean, who doesn't want to fly a tank?</p>

<h3>Anime</h3>

<h4>Howl's Moving Castle</h4>

<p>Tough choice, but the pick for my favorite anime movie is Howl's Moving Castle. Studio Ghibli is awesome and this is the movie that got me started watching anime movies.</p>
